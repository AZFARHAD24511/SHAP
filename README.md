# Bank Marketing Dataset and Visualization App

I have used the **Bank Marketing** dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) for my project.

Based on this dataset, I developed a user-friendly web application that allows users to explore the data and visualize outputs through interactive charts.

You can access the app here:  
[https://shapbanking.streamlit.app/](https://shapbanking.streamlit.app/)

The app enables easy browsing of the dataset features and interactive visualization of model predictions and explanations.
